# Flyway Introduction
Flyway is an open-source database migration tool. It strongly favors simplicity and convention over configuration. It is based on just 7 basic commands: Migrate, Clean, Info, Validate, Undo, Baseline, and Repair.
Migrations can be written in SQL (database-specific syntax (such as PL/SQL, T-SQL, …) is supported) or Java (for advanced data transformations or dealing with LOBs). With Flyway all changes to the database are called migrations. Migrations can be either versioned or repeatable.
